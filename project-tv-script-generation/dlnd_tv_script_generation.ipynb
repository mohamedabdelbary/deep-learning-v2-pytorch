    "Implement an RNN using PyTorch's [Module class](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#torch.nn.Module). You may choose to use a GRU or an LSTM. To complete the RNN, you'll have to implement the following functions for the class:\n",

    " - `init_hidden` - The initialization function for an LSTM/GRU hidden state\n",
    " - `forward` - Forward propagation function.\n",

    "The first attempt I tried was to use a sequence length of 100, with batches of 50 and a LSTM dimension of 128 (2 layers). This resulted in the training process being fairly slow and also the loss fluctuating quite a bit and struggling to reduce beyond say 3.7 loss. I thought increasing the sequence length to 200 and the size of the LSTM unit to 256 would help but it only resulted in making the training process slower and didn't help much with the fluctuating loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking a step back, and looking at the nature of this dataset, there was a clear possible reason for this. The data is that of a TV script that is mostly dialogue, so each contiguous piece of text is a sentence or two at most, and fairly short. Thus, a long sequence length doesn't necessarily help, but could actually hurt the learning process. It also makes the learning process slower as there's no parallelism involved in doing a forward pass and backpropagation in any given sequence, but the parallelisation is done across different batches, where each batch can be processed independently, taking advantage of the GPUs. Larger LSTM dimension of 256 didn't help either.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reverting back to 128 LSTM dimension and reducing the sequence length drastically from 200 to only 25 words, while increasing the batch size to 100 yielded significant improvement, with the training process going much faster, most likely due to increased parallelism and shorter sequences. The training process also started looking significantly healthier, with the loss fluctuating less as it trained through the epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of epochs tried initially was 10, but that only brought the loss down to about 3.55, but it was clear that the loss can drop further with more epochs, so this was increased to 30, and then to 50. With 50 epochs, we got to a loss of about 3.35 on the final epoch.\n",
